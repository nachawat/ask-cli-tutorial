# Lab 2: Alexa-Hosted with ASK CLI

With [Alexa-Hosted](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html), Alexa automatically provisions and manages a set of AWS cloud services for your skillâ€™s back-end without the need of an AWS Account.
You will gain access to an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function and associated [Amazon Cloudwatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html), an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket for media storage, and an Amazon S3-backed key-value table for managing session persistence.
When you create the skill, the service also sets up an [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) repository for managing your code, which you can access using the [Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) (ASK CLI) to edit your skill.
