# Lab 2: Alexa-Hosted with ASK CLI

## [CREATE](./01-create.md) | [EDIT](./02-edit.md) | [DEPLOY](./03-deploy.md) | **[TEST](./04-test-simulate.md)**

We will perform 4 basic type of tests using ASK CLI commands:

1. **[One Turn Simulation - Text Input](./04-test-simulate.md)** *<== CURRENT TEST*

1. [One Turn Simulation - JSON Input](./04-test-invoke.md)

1. [Multi-Turn Simulation](./04-test-dialog.md)

1. [Pre-Certification Tests](./04-test-pre-certification.md) 

# One Turn Simulation - Text Input

To start testing your skill, we will [`simulate`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html#simulate-command) an invocation of your skill with a text input.

It will test the input against your skill model and code. This is equivalent to speak to a device.

#### Command

```
ask simulate --locale en-US --text "open hosted hello world"
```

#### Expected Output

```json

#### What happened?

The ASK CLI used the [`Skill Simulation API`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-simulation-api.html) to forge a request to simulate a skill execution. 

The output provides us with the following information (among others):

* `status`: Current status of the simulation. One of: `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUCCESSFUL`, or `FAILED`.
* `result.alexaExecutionInfo.alexaResponses.content`: Object that contains the content of the Alexa response.
* `result.alexaExecutionInfo.consideredIntents`: An array contains at most 5 considered intents returned by natural language understanding (NLU).
* `result.skillExecutionInfo.invocations.invocationRequest.body`: JSON payload that was sent to the skill's AWS Lambda.
* `result.skillExecutionInfo.invocations.invocationResponse.body`: JSON Payload that was returned by the skill's AWS Lambda.

In case of error, the response will include an error message and the associated HTTP response status code
