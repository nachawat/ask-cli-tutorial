# Lab 2: Alexa-Hosted with ASK CLI

## [CREATE](./01-create.md) | [EDIT](./02-edit.md) | [DEPLOY](./03-deploy.md) | [TEST](./04-test-simulate.md) | **[BONUS](./05-bonus.md)**

In this section, we will focus on updating our skill on both the **interaction model** side as well as on the **backend code** side and look after the different steps to be performed. The objective will be to add to the skill the ability to collect the customer first name once we've prompted them and greet each customer with their first name afterwards.

# 1. Add an Intent to your Interaction Model

The Alexa Skills Kit is providing predefined slot types where a catalog of values have already been provided and trained by Alexa for you. To have the ability to collect customers first name, we will use the predefined `AMAZON.FirstName` slot type and create a new intent to collect such a value. We will provide to this intent a list of samples utterances to understand what the user will say. Within those utterances, to capture the customers' first name, we will define a new slot mapped to the `AMAZON.FirstName` type.

To perform this operation, you will edit the file `models/en-US.json` and add an intent named `MyNameIsIntent` the following way:

```json
{
    "interactionModel": {
        "languageModel": {
            "invocationName": "hello world",
            "intents": [
                {
                    "name": "MyNameIsIntent", 
                    "slots": [
                        {
                            "name": "first_name",
                            "type": "AMAZON.FirstName" 
                        }
                    ],
                    "samples": [
                        "{first_name}",
                        "my name is {first_name}", 
                        "you can call me {first_name}"
                    ]
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

# 2. Update your skill's code


```javascript
const MyNameIsIntentHandler = { 
    canHandle(handlerInput) {
        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === 'IntentRequest'
            && Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === 'MyNameIsIntent';
    }, 
    handle(handlerInput) {
        const firstname = Alexa.getSlotValue(handlerInput.requestEnvelope, "first_name"); 
        const speechText = `Welcome ${firstname}, it is my pleasure to meet you!`;
        return handlerInput.responseBuilder
            .speak(speechText)
            .getResponse();
    } 
};
```


# 3. Skill Modification: What happened ?

You added a new intent to capture users's firstname and prompts back their name.
For this change, you made the following operations:

* Add a new intent in your en-US Interaction Model (file: `models/en-US.json`).

* Add a new handler in your backend code (file: `lambda/index.js`).

* Attach the new handler into the request handler chain (file: `lambda/index.js`).

* Update the LaunchRequestHandler to change the prompt provided to the user (file: `lambda/index.js`).
