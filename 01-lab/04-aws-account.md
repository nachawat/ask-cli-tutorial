## Create a New AWS Account

Amazon Web Service (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. AWS makes it very easy to build and deploy Alexa Skills in the cloud without having to worry about provisioning or maintaining infrastructure.

This guide will walk you through the 4-step process of setting up a new Amazon AWS account.

If you already have an AWS account you can go to the next step and [Setup an AWS Profile](./04-aws-iam-profile.md).

> **Note:** If you'll be creating skills using [Alexa-Hosted](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html), an AWS account is not needed and you can skip those steps.
