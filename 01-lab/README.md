## Alexa Skill Building - Prerequisites

Alexa provides capabilities, or **skills**, that enable customers to create a more personalized experience. There are now tens of thousands of skills from companies like Starbucks, Uber, and Capital One as well as other innovative designers and developers.

Building a skill is easy, using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) - a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation, and code samples that makes it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa. ASK enables designers, developers, and brands to build engaging skills and reach customers through the tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up all the necessary resources to develop and publish Alexa Skills from the command line. These include:

* an Amazon Developer account
* Development Tools like NPM, Node.js, Git
* the ASK CLI
* an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account

**Do you have an Amazon Developer Portal Account?**

If you already have Amazon Developer Portal account that you would like to use, go straight to the ASK CLI setup, otherwise follow the guide and create a new Amazon Developer Portal account now.
